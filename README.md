NGIMU-MATLAB-Real-Time-Example
==============================

This example demonstrates how to receive NGIMU data in MATLAB in real-time via Wi-Fi.  The NGIMU must be configured to be send to the computer IP address before running this example.  The computer firewall settings must not be blocking MATLAB from having network access.
