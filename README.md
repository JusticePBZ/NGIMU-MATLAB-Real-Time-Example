NGIMU-MATLAB-Real-Time-Example
==============================

This is an example demonstrating how to receive NGIMU data in MATLAB in real-time via Wi-Fi.  The NGIMU must  be configured to be send to the computer IP address before running this example.  The example script opens a UDP socket to receive NGIMU messages, plots accelerometer data in real-time for 10 seconds, and then closes the connection.
